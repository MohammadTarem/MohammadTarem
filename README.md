 I started my career in software development in 2000. I was inspired by Microsoft technologies and began my development using Visual Studio and C++ language. I developed my first application using MFC and ADO frameworks. Then moved to .NET 2 and switched to C#. In almost all companies and projects that I worked on, I had to deal with clients, architecture, design and development of the software from the ground-up. Therefore, I gained a lot of experience in all phases of software development. Now my main focus is developing highly available and scalable solutions using .NET Core and Microsoft Azure.
